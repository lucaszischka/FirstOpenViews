# Why

Apple uses it in all of their apps, but unfortunately they don't make it available to us in their SDK. That's why I have my own implementation and make it available, as I have hardly found another good one on github.

# Requirements 

- iOS 13
- Swift 5.1
- Xcode 12

# Installation

The preferred way of installing FirstOpenViews is via the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).

>Xcode 11 integrates with libSwiftPM to provide support for iOS, watchOS, and tvOS platforms.

1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to **File** → **Swift Packages** → **Add Package Dependency...**
2. Paste the repository URL (`https://github.com/lucaszischka/FirstOpenViews`) and click **Next**.
3. For **Rules**, select **Branch** (with branch set to `main`).
4. Click **Finish**.

# Usage

## Basic Usage

**WARNING:**
This is Sample Code for visualisation where and how to use, without a working initializer. Please see [Examples](#examples) for working code

Same way you use Sheet in SwiftUI

### Life Cycle: UIKit App Delegate (IOS 13+)

````swift
//SceneDelegate.swift

func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
    let contentView = ContentView() //1
                                    .welcomeView() //2
                                    .whatsNewView() //3

    if let windowScene = scene as? UIWindowScene {
        let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
        window.rootViewController = UIHostingController(rootView: contentView)
        self.window = window
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()
    }
}
````

### Life Cycle: SwiftUI App (IOS 14+)

````swift
@main
struct TestApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView() //1
                .welcomeView() //2
                .whatsNewView() //3
        }
    }
}
````

`//1` You add it to the highest Navigation Level

`//2` This is how you add the WelcomeView (first launch)

`//3` This is how you add the WhatsNewView (after update)

# Parameters

## WelcomeView

**WARNING:**
This is Sample Code for visualisation of the parameters and their default values and value types, without a working initializer. Please see [Examples](#examples) for working code

````swift
.welcomeView(
    imageName: String? = nil,
    mainColor: Color = Color.blue,
    informationDetailViews: [InformationDetailView]
)
````

- `imageName`
  Here you can add a image to the sheet if you wish.

- `mainColor`
  Here you can change the color used for the App Name and the Continue Button.
  
- `informationDetailViews`
  Here you add the InformationDetailView's. Three are recommend. Please see [InformationDetailView](#InformationDetailView) for parameters.
  
## WhatsNewView

**WARNING:**

    informationDetailViews: [InformationDetailView]
)
````

- `imageName`
  Here you can add a image to the sheet if you wish.

- `mainColor`

````swift
InformationDetailView(
    title: String,
    subTitle: Sring,
    image: Image,
    mainColor: Color = Color.blue
)
````

- `title`
